		   <p> Block Blast is a Tetris-like puzzle game, challenging to eliminate as many blocks as possible in a 
		   limited space to get a higher score. It's also a simple yet challenging elimination game with logic skills and 
		   layout strategies, and every move determines whether you can get a high score.</p>
